## PAST MAJOR RESEARCH ACCOMPLISHMENTS (COLLABORATIVELY WITH STUDENTS AND COLLEAGUES) INCLUDE:

* Behavioral Analysis of Insider Threat. One of the first to predict who in an organization is likely to leak or steal sensitive information.
* Pareto Optimal Defense of Enterprise System. The first to develop optimal algorithms to protect an enterprise by helping a security officer decide what combination of patches to apply and what vulnerable software products to de-activate.
* Anti-Poaching Engine. The first to develope algorithms to learn behavioral models of both rhinos and poachers in Oliphants West Game Park (S. Africa). Showed how to optimally deploy a suite of drones and a set of ranger patrols on the ground to maximize expected number of protected rhinos.
* Destabilizing Terrorist Groups. The first to measure how terrorist network structure is linked to lethality of the group and methods to destabilize it.
* Identifying Bad Actors in Social Media. One of the first to develop algorithms to identify trolls on Slashdot, bots on Twitter, and vandals on Wikipedia.
* Identifying Activities in High Throughput Observation Streams. First to develop methods to identify high level activities (e.g. suspicious ones) in video streams and cybersecurity data
* Global Cyber-Vulnerability Report. First to characterize the cyber-vulnerability of 44 countries by examining billions of malware reports over 2 years covering over 4M hosts per year.
* First to develop data models and algorithms to reason about inconsistent databases
* Invented generalized annotated programs (GAPs) as a formalism for reasoning about diverse forms of uncertainty, time, and more
* First to develop a probabilistic logic rule language and temporal probabilistic rule language
* First to develop probabilistic relational database models without independence assumptions and built the first system (ProbView) that did so.
* First to develop probabilistic XML data models
* First to develop a logical calculus underlying multimedia databases and developed the first methods to query Interactive Multimedia Presentation (e.g. PowerPoint) databases
* First to develop a logical calculus and system to integrate multiple databases and software packages together
* Developed the first query optimizer and view maintenance algorithms for heterogeneous databases
* Developed one of the first flexible authorization modeling languages for computer security and showed how to implement it efficiently
* Founded the field of computational cultural dynamics and developed the SOMA (Stochastic Opponent Modeling Agent) paradigm to reason about terrorist group behaviors
* Developed the first algorithm to quantify intensity of sentiment on a topic on a continuous scale and to compute this effiently
* Developed one of the fastest subgraph matching and indexing algorithms in the world
* Developed the concept of Temporal Probabilistic Rules and applied them to reason about terrorist group behaviors
* Developed the first comprehensive computational models of any terrorist group by building such models of Lashkar-e-Taiba and the Indian Mujahideen.
* Developed numerous public forecasts about attacks by Hezbollah, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Indian Mujahideen
* Developed algorithms to automatically compute policies to help shape terrorist group behaviors
* First to develop the concept of Geospatial Abduction to infer geospatial locations of objects from observations. Used this theory to develop the Socio-Cultural Adversarial Reasoning Engine (SCARE) that predicted locations of IED weapons caches in Baghdad to within 700m and identified regions in Afghanistan’s Kandahar and Helmand provinces where the density of high value targets (HVTs) was 35 times the average in the province as a whole.
* First to develop algorithms and models to destabilize terror networks and the development of the STONE system to do so.
* First to develop models of diffusion in social networks that incorporate elements of both logic and uncertainty.
* Introduced the concept of diffusion centrality so that important nodes can be identified w.r.t. specific topics, not with respect to just the structure of the network
* Introduced the concept of Social Network Diffusion Optimization Problems and gave the first methods to solve them taking almost any diffusion model into account;
* Developed one of the first methods to reason about competitive situations in social network diffusions
* First to develop methods to forecast how a piece of malware will spread through a population of hosts.
* First to develop models of sockpuppet behavior and predict them.
* First to develop highly accurate predictive models of demand and market share along airline routes and use them to increase airline profits.
* First to identify bots on Twitter that are seeking to covertly influence opinion of a specific topic.
* One of the first to develop a game-theoretic method to alert cyber analysts about which machines to monitor within an enterprise.

## ONGOING WORK:

* Studying the foundations of signed networks.
* Automatically learning models of high-level activities (e.g. cyber-attacks) from observations and logs.
* Predictive analysis of airline demand and marketshare and methods to leverage those predictions for increased profitability.
* Analysis of signed weighted networks and predicting edge weights.
* Predicting gorilla behavior.
* Algorithms for behavior model based evacuation of buildings.
* Developing a game-theoretic method to alert cyber analysis about which machines to monitor within an enterprise.
* Analyzing the ISI. Conducting a comprehensive behavioral analysis of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence Agency.
* Analyzing Terror Group-Group Interactions. Developing new models to learn interactions between terrorist groups with a view to more efficiently destabilizing them. Initial focus on South Asia.
* Learning Terrorist Group Payoffs. Developing algorithms to learn payoffs for different actions taken by actors such as terrorist groups. Based on this, we are identifying payoffs for terrorist groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba based on different scenarios.
